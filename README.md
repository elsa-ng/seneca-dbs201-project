  <b>Database Design for Oakville Yards</b>
  <p>Design a database for Oakville Yards according to the Description of Operations described in <a href="https://github.com/elsa-ng/seneca-dbs201-project/blob/master/DBS201_Project_Requirements.doc">DBS201_Project_Requirements.doc</a>. In order to achieve a relational database design, normalizations up to 3NF are required and listed in <a href="https://github.com/elsa-ng/seneca-dbs201-project/blob/master/DBS201_Project_Solution.docx">DBS201_Project_Solution.doc</a>. An ERD diagram (<a href="https://github.com/elsa-ng/seneca-dbs201-project/blob/master/ERD.png">ERD.png</a>) depicts the relationships between each table, and the database is then implemented according that ERD diagram.</p>
